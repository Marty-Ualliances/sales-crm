# Project Context

This is a **Sales CRM** project built with the following tech stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16+, React 19, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui (Radix UI), React Query, Zod.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express 5, TypeScript.
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose).

## Preferred Skills

When working on this codebase, you must proactively consult and adhere to the following provided skills to ensure the highest standards of quality, security, and performance. 

### 🏗️ CORE — Stack & Architecture
- `@nextjs-best-practices`: App Router principles — Server vs Client component decision tree, data fetching patterns, routing structure.
- `@nodejs-best-practices`: Node.js decision-making principles — framework patterns, async patterns, security, and architecture.
- `@backend-dev-guidelines`: Comprehensive backend guide for Node.js/Express/TypeScript — covers layered architecture, BaseController pattern, error handling, Zod validation.
- `@typescript-expert`: TypeScript mastery and advanced types — tighten types, catch bugs at compile time.
- `@backend-architect`: Backend architecture patterns, API design, database optimization, and server-side best practices.
- `@clean-code`: Code readability and maintainability — critical for team collaboration.

### 🔒 SECURITY — Must-Have for Internal Tools
- `@auth-implementation-patterns`: JWT, OAuth2, session management — lock down access control.
- `@api-security-best-practices`: Secure API design patterns — prevent common Express API vulnerabilities.
- `@backend-security-coder`: Secure backend coding practices.
- `@frontend-security-coder`: XSS prevention and client-side security.
- `@cc-skill-security-review`: Security checklist for features — run this on every new feature before shipping.

### 🧪 TESTING & QUALITY
- `@test-driven-development`: Write tests retroactively for existing code and for new functionality.
- `@systematic-debugging`: Debug issues methodically instead of using `console.log` everywhere.
- `@performance-optimization`: Find and fix bottlenecks in the Next.js + Express + Mongo pipeline.

### 🎨 POLISH — UI & UX
- `@frontend-design`: Production-grade UI polish.
- `@ui-ux-pro-max`: Professional UI/UX — color, fonts, layouts, spacing.
- `@tailwind-patterns`: Responsive design patterns for Tailwind.
- `@frontend-dev-guidelines`: Opinionated frontend standards for React + TypeScript — Suspense-first data fetching, lazy loading, feature-based architecture.

### ⚡ EFFICIENCY & OPS
- `@docker-expert`: Containerize your app for consistent deployment across environments.
- `@brainstorming`: Use before creative or constructive work — plan features and architecture before building.
- `@github-automation`: Automate PR reviews, issue triage, CI/CD.
- `@bullmq`: Redis-backed job queues, background processing, and reliable async execution.

## Directives
- Treat the skills above identically to how you treat your baseline skills. When a task requires action, check if there's a corresponding awesome-skill that fits your workflow.
- Ensure that you mention which skill you are applying if making technical decisions.
